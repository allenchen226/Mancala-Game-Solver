Inside this repository, you'll find a program that can solve Mancala games by finding the best possible moves for a player based on the current game state. Mancala is a popular board game that involves two players taking turns to move stones or seeds across holes or pits on the board.

The Mancala game solver program, which is written in Python, applies advanced game theory algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to analyze the game state and determine the optimal moves for the player. Additionally, the program comes with a user-friendly graphical interface that allows players to input their own game state and get the best possible moves generated by the solver.
